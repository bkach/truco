# Truco [WIP]

![](assets/1ofspades.jpg)

This Repo is a simple implementation of the game [Truco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truco) written in
[go](https://golang.org/) and [react](https://reactjs.org) running on [buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en/).

# How to Run

1. `cd` to the cloned directory
2. Run the command: `go run main.go`
3. Navigate to `localhost:8000`
4. If you see output similar to:

`{"game_id":"game_ffa71ce1-86e1-46b3-870f-b6fc3a019124"}`

It's working!

# Endpoints

For a list of endpoints and how to use them, take a look at the [`routes.go`](https://github.com/bkach/truco-backend/blob/master/routers/routes.go) file.

# ToDo

Quite a lot. WIP!
